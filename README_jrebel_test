This branch is for testing jrebel.

Tested. Result:
- free for OSS and Scala
- maven, jetty setup: http://www.zeroturnaround.com/reference-manual/server.html#server-4.4.15
  - work correctly
  - tested: add, remove imports, change code (jetty auto refresh was turned off)
- eclipse
  - tested in debug mode (unit tests)
  - not work if the debugged (and you are on a breakpoint in it) method was changed and compiled
  - work if different method was chnaged
  
Seems fast.
